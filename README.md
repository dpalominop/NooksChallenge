# nooks-ml-takehome

Challenge proposed by Nooks.

## Steps:
The suggested order to review this work is as follows:
1. explore-data.ipynb
2. pipeline.ipynb
3. export.ipynb

However, you can go directly to pipeline.ipynb or export.ipynb and review or execute the notebook, because results from previous notebooks are saved as independent modules.
Also, we have created an optional train.py script to run training step, similar to pipeline.ipynb.
